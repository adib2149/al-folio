Although it's been a long time, I wanted to start back my habit of blogging and microblogging gradually. I don't actually remember when I last wrote a blog; I feel like it was back in 2017. Anyway, a lot has happened since then, and I should start writing a little bit every week just to keep track of the many things that have been going on in my life.

Since 2017, I have moved to the USA and started my PhD. I finished my PhD in Computer Science (Yay to my dream of studying CS) back in 2022, along with a master's degree, and I have had two jobs since then. Currently, I'm a research scientist at the California Department of Public Health.

What else? Well, I've been a dad since 2022. We have a wonderful kid named Audriyana, who keeps us busy throughout the day.

For the last year, I have been sick on and off, and although no one really diagnosed it, I believe I have been suffering from Long Covid. It's a brand new health issue; no one knows why it affects some people after COVID-19 and doesn't affect others. I'm still wrapping my head around it; although I have somehow learned to manage some of my symptoms, I know it's still going to be a very long journey.

Due to this issue, I had to slow down my habit of singing, practicing, listening to music, video gaming, and most physical activities. However, I picked some new hobbies. I kind of got into board games and also do a little bit of gardening and fishing.

Finally, I also want to resume writing about my tech stuff, data science & CS knowledge, and general findings about my life. 

So here goes nothing, hoping for a fresh new start.
