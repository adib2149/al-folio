I am currently a Research Scientist III, in the Data and Analytics Division within the Epidemiological Research Section, at the [Center for Health Care Quality](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/Pages/CHCQHome.aspx), [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/). I am also a Marquette alumnus, an ex-BUETian, and an ex-cadet.

<!-- I am currently a Sr. Research Engineer at [Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute (OCTRI)](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri) in [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu), Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. -->

I have 5+ years of research experience in Machine Learning & Data Science for healthcare; as well as software development & engineering. I have had 15+ publications and service as reviewer in 10+ conferences and journals in the Healthcare and Machine Learning domain. Currently, I am actively working in the field of `Causal Inference`; my primary focus is to apply Causal Inference and related theories in exploring cause-and-effect relationships in experimental and observational datasets.

My research goals aim to achieve `data-driven causal explorations`, mostly for `Electronic Healthcare Data` My primary tools are `Structural Causal Models`, `Propensity Score Matching`, `A/B Testing` and a little bit of `Do-Why`. Please visit my [research page](/research) to read more on this.

Outside research activities, I destress mostly by singing. My other hobbies include playing guitar, reading thriller books, playing board games, PS5 games & basketball, and some more. Please visit my [hobbies page](/hobbies) to read more on this.
